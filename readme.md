# Image Sharpening with Knowledge Distillation

This project implements an image sharpening technique using knowledge distillation. A lightweight convolutional neural network (StudentCNN) is trained to approximate the output of a high-performing model (SwinIR) on downscaled images. The student model is optimized for real-time performance and evaluated using SSIM metrics to compare its output against both the teacher model and bicubic interpolation.

## Project Structure

- `studentcnn.py`: Training script for the StudentCNN using hybrid L1 + SSIM loss.
- `stuops.py`: Inference script for generating sharpened outputs from the trained student model.
- `studentcnn_checkpoints/`: Contains saved model weights from training.
- `dataset/`: Folder with interpolated and high-resolution training images.

## Model Details

- **Teacher Model**: SwinIR (pretrained), used to generate supervision signals.
- **Student Model**: Shallow CNN designed for speed and low memory usage.
- **Training Strategy**: Knowledge distillation with hybrid loss:
  - L1 loss (sharpness)
  - SSIM loss (structural similarity)
- **Optimizations**:
  - LR scheduling
  - Reduced image resolution
  - Tiling to avoid OOM issues
  - CUDA acceleration

## Results

| Method     | SSIM Score |
|------------|------------|
| SwinIR     | 0.9457     |
| StudentCNN | 0.9085     |
| Bicubic    | 0.8965     |

## Inference Speed

The student model supports real-time inference (~30 FPS) on 1080p images (1920Ã—1080) when run with batch size 2 on an NVIDIA RTX 3050 Laptop GPU.
